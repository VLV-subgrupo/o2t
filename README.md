Capstone project for the Software Engineering discipline (MC656), which proposes a web application to help Olympic athletes, offering features such as training tracker, health metrics monitoring and weekly planning.

Members:
- Luiz Guilherme Sousa Nascimento - 230667

### Code

The software coding consists of a web application separated into three essential components:
- Database (MySQL).
- Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- Frontend (Next.js)
  
Each portion has a specific Docker container, which allows the independence and modularization of the software, facilitating development.

### Version control

The main development branch is "develop".
From the "develop" branch, we created the "backend" and "frontend" branches, which will allow greater independence between frontend and backend development throughout the process.

### Team

The members were divided into 2 groups:
- Dev Backend and Database (Luiz Guilherme Sousa Nascimento and Vitor Paziam Magalh√£es)
- Dev Frontend (Victor Wu and Luiz Fernando Lima Leite)

Pull requests made against the "backend" branch will be reviewed by another backend developer who is not the author of the PR. In the same way, it will also be done for the "frontend" branch.
