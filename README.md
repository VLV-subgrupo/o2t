### Code

The software coding consists of a web application separated into three essential components:
- Database (MySQL).
- Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- Frontend (Next.js)
  
Each portion has a specific Docker container, which allows the independence and modularization of the software, facilitating development.

### Version control

The main development branch is "develop".
From the "develop" branch, we created the "backend" and "frontend" branches, which will allow greater independence between frontend and backend development throughout the process.

### Team

The members were divided into 2 groups:
- Dev Backend and Database (Luiz Guilherme Sousa Nascimento and Vitor Paziam Magalhães)
- Dev Frontend (Victor Wu and Luiz Fernando Lima Leite)
